# react-dnd-provider

Minimal TypeScript implementation that exposes a react-beautiful-dnd-like API: `DragDropContext`, `Droppable`, and `Draggable`.

This package is a starting point — it provides a simple HTML5-backed drag/drop flow and types. Extend as needed.

Quick build:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
